# 🚗 FOTA Graduation Project: Smart Autonomous Car

**Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) Applied on Smart Autonomous Car with Voice Assistant & Safety Features**

This is my graduation project, which aims to implement core functionalities of a smart autonomous car using embedded systems and AI-based voice control.

---

## 🔧 Features Implemented

- **Manual Car Control System** via UART commands (`W`, `S`, `A`, `D`, `X`)
- **Self-Parking System** using ultrasonic sensors and automated maneuvers
- **Voice Assistant Integration** using Google Speech-to-Text → commands sent to STM32
- **Collision Avoidance** with ultrasonic sensors
- **Temperature Monitoring** using LM35 sensor
- **FOTA (Firmware Over The Air)** update system via serial communication
